Physical AI and embodied AI bring large-scale machine learning to robotics — agents that perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. This is a curated, engineering-oriented map of <strong>Physical AI resources</strong>: robot learning, foundation models for robotics, vision-language-action (VLA) models, world models, simulation and sim-to-real, datasets and benchmarks, generalist policies, and patterns for safe, production-grade systems.
</p>

<p align="center">
Built for researchers and practitioners across the stack — from foundations to deployment — and for technical leaders weighing how embodied intelligence will reshape products, operations, and infrastructure.

**New to Physical AI? Start here.**  
Physical AI sits at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, simulation, and embodied decision-making. The easiest way to begin is to start in simulation, understand the learning loop, then move toward robot policies, foundation models, and real-world systems.

### Quick start path

**1. Learn the core reinforcement learning loop**  
Start with [Gymnasium CartPole](https://gymnasium.farama.org/introduction/train_agent/) to build intuition for states, actions, rewards, and policies.

**2. Explore simulation**  
Use [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) to understand how control, physics, contacts, and robot dynamics are modelled.

**3. Inspect a modern robot-learning workflow**  
Browse [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) to see how robot datasets, policies, training, and evaluation are structured in practice.

**4. Explore the frontier of embodied foundation models**  
Look at [OpenVLA](https://openvla.github.io/) to understand how vision-language-action models connect perception, language, and robot control.

**5. Move deeper when ready**  
Once the above feels clear, continue into imitation learning, generalist robot policies, sim-to-real methods, hardware, and evaluation.

### Choose your route

- **Foundations** — simulation, control, reinforcement learning, and core robot-learning concepts  
- **Robot Learning** — imitation learning, diffusion policies, and visuomotor control  
- **Foundation Models** — VLA models, generalist policies, world models, and large-scale robot data  
- **Evaluation & Safety** — benchmarks, robustness, deployment constraints, and responsible embodied AI  
- **Hardware** — low-cost robot platforms and practical embodied projects

> **Tip:** You do not need hardware to begin.  
> Start with simulation first, then move to real-world systems when you understand the learning and evaluation loop.
