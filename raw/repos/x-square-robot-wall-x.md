## Building General-Purpose Robots Based on Embodied Foundation Model

We are building embodied foundation models to capture and compress the world's
most valuable data: continuous, high-fidelity physical interaction.

By creating a direct feedback loop between model decisions and the body's lived
experience, we enable generalizable intelligence that understands not just how
the world works, but how to act effectively within it.

## Repository

This repository provides the training and inference code for the WALL series
open-source embodied foundation models. It includes LeRobot data preparation,
model configuration, flow-matching and FAST action branches, public serving and
evaluation utilities, and exported CUDA operator sources that compile during
package installation.

## News

- [June 2026] Wall-X 1.1.0 updates the open-source training and inference
  stack for Wall-OSS-0.5, including the public serving/evaluation runtime,
  DMuon training support, and install-time CUDA operator builds.
- [May 2026] We introduce [**WALL-WM: Carving World Action Modeling at the Event Joints**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.01955), a World Action Model that couples future-video imagination with action prediction at semantic event boundaries.
- [May 2026] We introduce [**Wall-OSS-0.5: A Deployment-Ready VLA with Gradient-Bridged Pretraining**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.30877v2), an open-source model for directly deployable real-robot manipulation and downstream adaptation.
- [Sept 2025] We introduce [**WALL-OSS: Igniting VLMs toward the Embodied Space**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11766), an end-to-end embodied foundation model that leverages large-scale multimodal pretraining to achieve embodiment-aware vision-language understanding, language-action association, and robust manipulation capability.

## Models

- WALL-OSS-0.5: https://huggingface.co/x-square-robot/wall-oss-0.5
- WALL-OSS-FLOW-0.1: https://huggingface.co/x-square-robot/wall-oss-flow-0.1
- WALL-OSS-FLOW: https://huggingface.co/x-square-robot/wall-oss-flow
- WALL-OSS-FAST: https://huggingface.co/x-square-robot/wall-oss-fast

## Environment Setup

Create and activate a conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name wallx python=3.10
conda activate wallx
```

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASH_ATTN_CUDA_ARCHS=$(python -c 'import torch; print(f"{torch.cuda.get_device_capability()[0]}{torch.cuda.get_device_capability()[1]}")')
MAX_JOBS=4 pip install flash-attn==2.8.3 --no-build-isolation
```

Install DMuon, which is used by the default training configs:

```bash
pip install "dmuon @ git+https://github.com/X-Square-Robot/dmuon.git"
```

Install LeRobot:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
cd lerobot
pip install --no-deps -e .
```

Use `--no-deps` for LeRobot so it does not override the Wall-X dependency
versions installed from `requirements.txt`.

Install Wall-X:

```bash
MAX_JOBS=8 pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```

Public helper scripts live under `scripts/`; the examples below use the
repository-root form, such as `python scripts/fake_inference.py`.

The exported CUDA operator sources are included in
`wall_x/model/core/ops/csrc/`. `setup.py` builds them with PyTorch
`CUDAExtension` when Wall-X is installed. `ninja` is included in
`requirements.txt` for parallel builds, and `MAX_JOBS` controls compile
parallelism. `--no-build-isolation` is required so the build can use the torch
package already installed in the active environment.

## Training

### Finetune on LeRobot Datasets

Before training, see `workspace/README.md` for configuration details,
including:

- Training script configuration
- GPU setup
- Model and data paths
- Robot DOF configuration
- Training hyperparameters

Download the pretrained checkpoint, copy
`workspace/example/lerobot/qwen2_5_lerobot_template.yml`, replace the
placeholder paths, and launch training with:

```bash
python -m wall_x.trainer.fsdp_trainer.train_fsdp --config <path/to/config.yml>
```

For Wall-OSS-0.5 fine-tuning, normalization, LIBERO evaluation, and open-loop
WebSocket evaluation instructions, see `workspace/README.md`.

## Inference

### Basic Action Inference

For a minimal end-to-end example, run:

```bash
python scripts/fake_inference.py --checkpoint-path <path/to/checkpoint>
```

This script demonstrates how to:

- Load the Wall-OSS model with `Qwen2_5_VLMoEForAction.from_pretrained()`
- Prepare proprioceptive inputs, attention masks, and dataset specs
- Run inference in `validate` mode at bfloat16
- Validate output shape and check numerical stability

### Simulator Evaluation

Convenience launchers for closed-loop simulator evaluation live under
`scripts/`. LIBERO simulator setup is optional and documented with the helper
scripts; see `scripts/README.md`.

```bash
bash scripts/run_libero.sh <path/to/checkpoint>
```

### WebSocket Serving

Start a Wall-X WebSocket server with:

```bash
bash scripts/run_serving.sh \
  --checkpoint-path <path/to/checkpoint> \
  --train-config-path <path/to/config.yml> \
  --port 32195
```

The wrapper has no built-in checkpoint path. It returns raw model action chunks
by default, which is suitable for open-loop evaluation. Pass
`--serialize-actions` for clients that expect robot-serialized actions.

### Open-Loop WebSocket Evaluation

To compare predictions from a running Wall-X WebSocket server against LeRobot
ground truth, run:

```bash
python scripts/draw_openloop_plot.py \
  --uri ws://127.0.0.1:32195 \
  --dataset-root <path/to/lerobot_dataset> \
  --train-config <path/to/config.yml> \
  --episode-indices 0,1,2
```
