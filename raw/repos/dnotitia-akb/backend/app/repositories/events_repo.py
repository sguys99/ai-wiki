"""Repository for the `events` outbox.

`emit_event` is the only insertion point — every domain service that
wants to broadcast a change calls it from inside its own transaction so
the event lands atomically with the change. The publisher worker drains
the table separately (`delete_worker` pattern).

Why no class wrapper: each call is a one-shot INSERT; class state
(pool, etc.) buys nothing and the explicit `conn` arg makes the
transactional contract obvious at the call site.

    """Append one event to the outbox. MUST run inside the same
    transaction as the domain change so a rollback also drops the
    event — that's the only way to guarantee subscribers never see an
    event for a write that didn't actually land.

    `kind` is the canonical event name. Convention: `<resource>.<verb>`
    (e.g. `document.put`, `document.update`, `document.delete`,
    `vault.grant`, `publication.publish`). Keep it short and stable;
    subscribers will filter on it.

    `resource_uri` is the canonical akb:// handle for the resource the
    event is about — same format MCP clients see. Use the doc_uri /
    table_uri / file_uri helpers from `app.services.uri_service` to
    build it. Pass None for events that don't reference an in-vault
    resource (user / vault / collection — collections aren't URI-
    addressable; their identity goes in `payload.path` if needed).

    `actor_id` is TEXT — mirrors `documents.created_by`. The MCP path
    passes a username, not a UUID, so we don't try to coerce.

    `payload` is a small JSON blob — keep it bounded. Don't dump the
    full document body here; subscribers can `akb_get` if they need
    content. Useful: title, path, doc_type, prior commit hash, etc.

    Returns the new event id.
