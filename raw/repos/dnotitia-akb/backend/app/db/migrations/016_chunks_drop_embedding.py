"""Migration 016: drop chunks.embedding + embed_* columns.

Phase 4 of the vector-store driver abstraction (see
docs/design/2026-05-07-vector-store-driver-abstraction.md).

Source-of-truth split flips: main PG holds chunk text + metadata only;
the *vector store* (Qdrant or pgvector — operator's choice) owns the
dense embedding and the corpus-side BM25 sparse vector. Re-indexing
from text is always cheap because vocab + tokenizer + embedding model
are deterministic functions of (content, model_id).

Concrete changes:
- Drop chunks.embedding (was vector(N), forced main PG to load
  pgvector extension even when the operator wanted a separate vector
  store).
- Drop embed_next_attempt_at, embed_retry_count, embed_last_error.
  The legacy two-stage pipeline (embed_worker → vector_indexer) is
  collapsed into a single "indexing" stage now driven entirely by
  vector_*_at columns.
- Force-NULL all rows' vector_indexed_at so the unified indexer
  re-populates the vector store from text. Operators should expect a
  one-time re-index window proportional to chunk count × embed
  throughput (~60-120 min for ~600k chunks at typical OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint speeds).

Idempotent on a partially-applied DB (DROP IF EXISTS).
