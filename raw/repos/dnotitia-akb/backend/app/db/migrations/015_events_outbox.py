"""Migration 015: events outbox + LISTEN/NOTIFY trigger.

Domain change events (document put/update/delete, link/unlink, vault
grant, publish/unpublish, etc.) land in `events` in the same transaction
as the change itself — transactional outbox. A separate worker drains
the table to Redis Streams when configured; an in-process listener can
wake on `pg_notify('akb_events', id::text)` for SSE fanout without
polling.

PG is the source of truth: even if Redis is down for hours, no events
are lost — they accumulate in `events` and the publisher catches up
when Redis comes back. Same crash-safety pattern as
`vector_delete_outbox` (migration 005).

Idempotent.
