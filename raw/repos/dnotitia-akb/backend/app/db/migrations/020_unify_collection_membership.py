"""Migration 020: unified collection membership for documents / tables / files.

Before:  `documents.collection_id` FK to collections (since migration 011).
         `vault_files.collection` is a free-form TEXT field — never normalized
         against `collections`. `vault_tables` has no collection concept.

After:   All three resource types reference `collections.id` via a
         nullable `collection_id` FK (NULL == vault root). The legacy
         `vault_files.collection` TEXT column is removed in the same
         migration — no two-source-of-truth window.

Migration logic:

1.  ALTER TABLE vault_tables ADD COLUMN collection_id UUID
       REFERENCES collections(id) ON DELETE SET NULL.
2.  ALTER TABLE vault_files  ADD COLUMN collection_id UUID
       REFERENCES collections(id) ON DELETE SET NULL.
3.  For every vault_files row whose `collection` text is non-empty,
    ensure a matching `collections` row exists (insert one if not),
    then set vault_files.collection_id to it.
    Empty / NULL text → leave collection_id NULL (= vault root).
4.  Verify: every row's collection state is consistent — either both
    NULL (root) or both NOT NULL with the FK target's path matching
    the original text. Abort the migration on mismatch.
5.  DROP COLUMN vault_files.collection.

Idempotent on partial application — re-running after step 5 finds the
column missing and the FK columns present; the `_already_applied`
check below catches that and exits cleanly.
