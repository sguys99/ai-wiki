"""Per-vault health aggregator.

Composes per-vault pending_stats() calls into a single response that
mirrors a subset of the global /health endpoint. The auth check
happens in the route handler; this module just composes.

Post-Phase-4 indexing is one stage (embed + sparse + vector-store
upsert), so the vector-store side carries the only backfill counter.
