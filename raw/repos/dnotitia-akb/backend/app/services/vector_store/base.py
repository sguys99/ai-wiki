"""Vector store driver Protocol + shared types.

`VectorStore` is an interface; concrete drivers live in sibling
modules (`qdrant.py`, `pgvector.py`). Service-layer code depends on
the Protocol only — zero driver-specific imports leak past this
package boundary.

Sparse encoding is the *caller's* responsibility:
- `embed_worker` runs `sparse_encoder.encode_document` before upsert.
- `search_service` runs `sparse_encoder.encode_query` before search.

This keeps BM25 logic in one place (vocab + stats live in main PG)
and lets a future non-BM25 driver (SPLADE etc.) accept and ignore the
inputs without restructuring callers.
