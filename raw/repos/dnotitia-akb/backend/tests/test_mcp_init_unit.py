"""Unit test: Server('akb') initialization includes the bootstrap instructions.

INSTRUCTIONS lives in mcp_server/instructions.py (a lightweight module with
no heavy deps).  server.py imports and re-exports it; the Server("akb") call
in server.py receives instructions=INSTRUCTIONS.

We verify:
  1. The INSTRUCTIONS constant is well-formed.
  2. server.py's source wires INSTRUCTIONS into the Server(...) constructor,
     confirmed by a static grep of the source file (avoids importing the full
     server chain which requires kiwipiepy / psycopg / /data/ filesystem).
