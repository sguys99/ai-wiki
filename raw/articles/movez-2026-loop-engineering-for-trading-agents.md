# Loop Engineering for trading agents: 12 Steps to build a self-running Quant desk

Movez @0xMovez · Jul 2

The leverage in investing moved. It's no longer about watching charts faster - it's about designing the loop that researches, decides, and trades for you. Here are the 12 steps, end to end, inside one app.

Most traders still run themselves like a script. They open ten tabs, read the same charts, type the same questions, and close the laptop - only to start over tomorrow.

9 in 10 never build a single loop that does the watching for them. No research that runs on a schedule, no strategy that backtests itself, no execution that fires while they sleep.

This is the 12-step roadmap to a quant desk that runs itself, built entirely inside Minara.

Every loop has the same five-beat anatomy. Hold this shape in your head - every one of the 12 steps below slots into one of these beats:

Minara closes that loop in one app across three surfaces, each owning a different stretch of the cycle. The whole guide is organized around them.

You don't need all three on day one. Most desks start with a single scheduled research Workflow and grow from there. But the power compounds when the surfaces connect - the output of one becomes the input of the next, which is the whole point of a loop.

12 steps. 3 loops. One desk that runs without you.

## Loop 1 • The Research Loop

### 01. Ask the market a real question

Every loop starts with a question worth answering on a schedule. In Chat, you don't search - you ask, and Minara pulls live market, on-chain, sentiment, and macro data behind the answer.

Open the Minara AI chat and enter the following test command:

```
How is the bond market signaling risk appetite for stocks and crypto right now?
```

The answer isn't a wall of links it's a structured read with the data behind it. That structure is what makes it loopable: a question that returns a consistent shape every time is a question you can schedule later (step 9).

Three more opening questions that produce schedulable answers - the difference is they each return a repeatable structure, not a one-off opinion:

```
What market phase are we in right now — risk-on, risk-off, or transition? Give me the three signals that matter most and how I should be positioned.
```

```
What are the top 5 Polymarket leaderboard traders betting on this week, and is there a consensus worth fading?
```

Before you ask anything, run this filter: would this question still be useful if it ran by itself every morning?

### 02. Deep-dive a single asset

Once the macro read points somewhere, narrow to one asset and pull the full picture - price action, on-chain flows, derivatives positioning, sentiment. This is the work that normally costs you five tabs and an hour.

```
Deep-dive $HYPE: funding rates, open interest, whale moves, and sentiment over the last 7 days. Where's the risk?
```

The reason this works for a loop is that Minara reads across six data domains in a single pass. Knowing what's available tells you what to ask for - here's the map:

- Markets: live prices, OHLCV, ETF/macro, financial analytics
- Onchain: wallet assets, transfers, top holders, unlocks, whale alerts
- Signals: whale moves, news, sentiment, narrative signals, calendars
- Derivatives: funding rates, OI, liquidations, exchange flows, borrow rates
- Predictions: Polymarket search, positions, leaderboards, activity
- DeFi: pool data, yield discovery, DEX trends, Pendle markets

The deep-dive prompt that consistently produces a tradeable read names the domains explicitly - it tells Minara which lenses to combine rather than leaving it to guess:

```
Full thesis on $SOL: trend (markets), holder concentration (onchain), funding + OI skew (derivatives), and narrative momentum (signals). End with a one-line risk/reward call.
```

### 03. Audit your own trades

A self-improving loop needs a verifier - something that grades the work instead of agreeing with it. Before you automate anything, point Minara at your own track record. The honest read on what you keep getting wrong is the most valuable input to every loop that follows.

```
Review my trades from the last month and suggest improvements. Where am I entering too early or sizing too big?
```

The model that writes a strategy is too easy on it. A separate pass that only critiques - your trades, your sizing, your timing - is the cheapest verifier you have.

### 04. Turn the hunch into a thesis

The last research step converts everything above into a written thesis with explicit entries, exits, and risk - the spec a strategy will be built from. Make Minara commit to numbers, not vibes.

The difference between a thesis you can build a strategy from and one you can't comes down to specificity. A loop can only automate what's measurable - so the thesis has to be measurable too:

Research that returns the same shape every time is research you can schedule.

## Loop 2 • The Strategy Loop

### 05. Prompt the strategy in plain language

Strategy Studio reads a sentence and emits a structured strategy spec - entries, exits, sizing, universe. No code, no quant background. The thesis from step 4 becomes a working strategy you can test in the same thread. These are the real prompt patterns the Studio is built around:

```
$HYPE momentum strategy (15m): long on ROC>0 + volume breakout, hold 10 bars; 10x, stop 2% target 5%, 6-month backtest.
```

Two structural choices shape what you build. Get them right and the backtest means something, get them wrong and you're testing the wrong thing entirely:

- Time-series: One asset through time. "When does this coin trigger?" Momentum, mean-reversion, breakout - anything keyed to an asset's own history.
- Cross-sectional: Many assets at one moment. "Which coins rank top today?" Relative strength, rotation, pairs - anything that compares a universe.

And you don't have to start from a sentence. Studio takes a thesis in four forms - pick whichever matches what you already have:

- Plain language - describe entries, exits, sizing in a sentence (the prompts above).
- Build with a Form - fill in asset, timeframe, and preferences in structured fields when you want precision over prose.
- Video to Strategy - saw a strategy breakdown on YouTube? Upload it and Studio generates a ready-to-trade version.
- Code to Strategy - paste Pine Script or code from any platform and it ports across.

### 06. Start from a proven template

If you'd rather not write the thesis from scratch, Studio ships four template families - each a known-good baseline you can fork and tune:

- Momentum - ride persistent trends with adaptive stops and volatility-aware sizing.
- Mean-reversion - fade extreme moves around a moving anchor when volume confirms exhaustion.
- Arbitrage - capture price dislocations across venues, pairs, and funding rates in real time.
- Pairs - long one asset, short its cointegrated twin; neutral to the tape, sensitive to the spread.

Pick the family that matches your thesis, then describe the asset and timeframe. The Studio handles the structure; you bring the edge.

### 07. Backtest with risk built in

Studio replays the strategy against 10+ years of market data in seconds - modeling fees, funding, borrow, and slippage from venue-specific cost curves. You get the equity curve, but more importantly you get the risk beside the return: rolling max-drawdown, a forward volatility cone, and an exposure map so concentration never hides.

Walk-forward, out-of-sample, and regime-sliced views come on every run, and a leakage check flags suspicious results automatically - the difference between a backtest that survives live and one that only looked good on paper.

The metric that decides whether a strategy is worth deploying isn't total return - it's return per unit of risk. Two strategies can post similar returns with completely different risk profiles.

Minara puts the risk right next to the reward, three ways:

- Drawdown - the worst path, visible.
- Volatility cone - calibrated to regime
- And the exposure map so concentration risk never hides - a per-symbol view of where the capital actually sits. Darker means heavier weight.

A finished backtest card - e.g. HYPE 15m Leveraged MACD, +366.15%, with the equity curve and the Max Drawdown / Win Rate / Sharpe row underneath.

### 08. Paper trade before real capital

A backtest is a promise. Paper trading is the receipt. Promote any backtest to paper with one click and Studio runs it on the same engine that powers live execution - same fee model, same slippage curve, same risk hooks - against live market data, no capital at stake.

When the paper run confirms what the backtest promised, the strategy has earned the right to real money. When it doesn't, you learned that for free. This is the verifier gate of the strategy loop - nothing goes live until the paper run says yes.

Before you promote a paper run to live, it should clear five checks. This is the gate that separates a strategy that survives from one that only looked good in a replay:

- Paper P&L tracks the backtest - within a reasonable band, not wildly below. A big gap means the backtest was optimistic about fills.
- The leakage check is clean - no future data crept into the signal.
- Out-of-sample holds up - the strategy works on data it wasn't tuned on, not just the in-sample window.
- Drawdown is survivable - you could sit through the worst path shown without pulling the plug.
- It works across regimes - the regime-sliced view doesn't show all the profit coming from one lucky month.

A backtest is a promise. Paper trading is the receipt.

## Loop 3 • The Execution Loop

### 09. Schedule the watching with Workflow

This is where the desk stops waiting for you. Workflow is no-code automation in plain language - you describe what should happen and when, and Minara builds the monitor. The example prompts the product ships with show exactly the shape:

```
30 minutes before the U.S. market opens, select 4 stocks and email me their tickers, entry prices, and a brief research note.
```

```
Set up a weekly market report to my email — tell me what phase we're in, why it matters, and how I should adjust my strategy.
```

Two more example prompts the product ships with - both produce a recurring monitor that emails you on a schedule:

```
Send me daily reports of the moves and on-chain activity of the top 3 holdings in my Minara wallet.
```

```
Every Sunday evening, email me a summary of the week's major macro events and how they affected the market.
```

If you'd rather not write a prompt, Quick Templates build standard workflows from simple form fields - Polymarket Address Monitor, Polymarket Odds Monitor, and Copy Trade are ready out of the box. Fill the fields, deploy, done.

### 10. Start alerts-only, then let it act

The safest loop earns trust before it earns permission. Every Workflow can run alerts-only first - it watches and notifies, but never executes. You read its calls for a week. When its judgment matches yours, you let it act.

```
Buy 200 USDT of $SOL if price ≤ 175 USDT, then take profit at 200 USDT and stop loss at 160 USDT.
```

That single sentence becomes a conditional order routed through Minara's monitor system for high-precision execution. Keep Telegram or email notifications on and you get a real-time receipt for every fire.

### 11. Hand the rules to Autopilot

A proven strategy goes live with one click to Autopilot, which runs it on Hyperliquid with deterministic rules - no discretionary trades, no hidden heuristics. When an entry or exit rule fires (a Supertrend flip, an RSI threshold, a grid level), Autopilot acts. Every position ships with mandatory take-profit and stop-loss, and the stop trails as the trade moves.

You stay in command of the boundaries: you authorize exactly which assets Autopilot can touch, set the leverage scope per symbol, and set an Initial Equity Drawdown Limit that flattens everything if hit. Close a position, pause the engine, or pull an asset from scope at any time - every manual action is treated as an intentional override, with no hidden retries.

You can start from an official strategy instead of building your own. Each comes with its own preset trading scope and risk framework:

- Sharpe Guard: 15m trend-following
- Supertrend Monitor: Multi-timeframe
- Classic Futures Grid: Range-bound
- Custom (Studio): Your own

Whatever strategy runs, four risk controls are non-negotiable - they're what makes handing over the wheel a discipline rather than a gamble:

- Mandatory TP/SL - every position opens with take-profit and stop-loss attached; they can't be silently removed while Autopilot is active.
- Trailing stop - the stop moves with the trade to lock in gains; if technicals turn sharply, Autopilot can close at market rather than wait.
- Equity drawdown limit - set a hard floor; if account equity hits it, everything flattens. The trade-level stop protects the trade; this protects the account.
- Trading scope - Autopilot only touches assets you authorize, at the leverage you allow. Everything outside scope stays in your hands.

### 12. Close the loop - and let it compound

Here's where twelve steps become one system. The Workflow that runs your morning research (step 9) feeds the thesis you refine in Chat (steps 1–4). That thesis becomes a strategy in Studio (steps 5–8). The strategy goes live on Autopilot (step 11). Autopilot's results become next week's trade review (step 3) - and the loop starts again, sharper.

Notice the three verifier gates in the middle - the trade audit (step 3), the paper run (step 8), and alerts-only mode (step 10). They're what keep an automated desk honest. A loop with no gate is just an agent agreeing with itself at speed, a loop with gates is a system that catches its own mistakes before they cost you.

One Workflow keeps it honest: a weekly review that grades the desk against itself

```
Every Sunday evening, email me a summary of the week's major macro events, how they affected my open positions, and what I should adjust.
```

That's the whole discipline: research feeds strategy, strategy feeds execution, execution feeds review, review feeds next week's research. You designed it once. Now it runs - and every loop leaves the next one a little smarter.

## Conclusion

Stop running yourself like a script. Design the loop instead.

For two years, trading edge meant reading faster, refreshing more tabs, catching the move before the next person. That phase is ending. The edge now is the loop you design - the research that runs on a schedule, the strategy that backtests itself, the execution that fires on rules while you're asleep.

Minara closes that loop in one app: ask in Chat, build in Strategy Studio, automate in Workflow, execute on Autopilot. Twelve steps from a hunch to a desk that runs itself - no code, full control, real risk discipline at every gate.

Pick one step you're not doing - probably your first scheduled Workflow, or a paper run before going live - and set it up today. Then the next. The desk compounds from there.
